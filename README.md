# Dynamic Programing challenges

This repository contains some interesting challenges and exercises solved with Java and dynamic programming techniques.  

## What is dynamic programming?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving a bigger and hard problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the bigger problem depends upon the optimal solution to its smaller sub-problems.

It uses several techniques to avoid O(n^2) complexity, that comes some times when you solve a problem using pure recursion approaches.
